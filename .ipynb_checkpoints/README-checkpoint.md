# Heart Disease Predictor
Kaggle Competition Heart Disease Predictor compares the performance of three models - K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest classifier with randomized search for hyperparameter tuning,and XGBoost classifier. See [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction) for dataset source and competition.

Results: Random Forest classifier with randomized search performed as the best predictor with accuracy of 85%.

This process also shows the effect of additional preprocessing methods including feature standardization and binning.
